AWS DE Bootcamp labs

## Description:
This repo contains files to comlplete labs from the Udemy course Ultimate AWS Data Engineering bootcamp: 
  https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-data-engineering-bootcamp-with-real-world-lab

My goal for the outcome(s) of this course and code repository is to build a body of knowledge of DE concepts specifically related to AWS services and PySpark
as well as to put these concepts into practice. 

This repo will also serve as a template to return to for future engaements where the tech stack includes AWS services and is PySpark heavy.
